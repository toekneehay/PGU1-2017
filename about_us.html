				<h3 style="text-align:left; font-style:italic;">Our mission is to provide the community with assistance with transportation and the access to knowledge through learning.  While also providing the community with access to gratuitous amounts of energy through coffee and the best cup of coffee at that.</h3> 
				<p>We started this journey in 2018 but the concept was thought up much earlier.  While hanging out with his in-laws and trying to understand what was being said on the Serbian television channel, the owner Tony May, heard a concept that would stick in his head for years to come.  This concept turned into Bearing Coffee which combined three concepts that excite Tony.  Coffee, bicycling, reading.</p>
				<p>Tony was impressed by a shop that had been developed in Serbia, created by a traveler.  An all-around place which served various amounts of coffee, direct from the farm and organically grown.  Transportation and clean energy is important to Tony and bicycling is his preferred method of getting around, this shop on this television program had a place where one could work on bicycles for a fee and be helped by bicycle professionals get their bicycle in working order.  Tony throughout his life was an avid reader and hated seeing books thrown away in the landfill for no reason, this shop had a library system free to the patrons.  Tony always had the vision in his head of bringing this to Iowa and after many years of kicking it around he brought it to a reality in 2018. </p>
