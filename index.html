				<p>Bearing Coffee is not your average coffee shop. Yes, we do make a great cup of coffee from the finest beans, but we also offer other services in our business.  Looking for a place to read a book, or how about check out a book, or even purchase a book?  We have you covered.  Looking to repair your bicycle, or learn how to repair a bicycle?  We also have you covered. We provide bicycle repair service for the general public and will also help you learn how to repair your own.  We have book service in our coffee shop allowing you to check out a used book or purchase a used book or even buy a new book from our selection.  </p>
				<p>Let us not forget our coffee though.  We used single-origin coffee beans direct from the farmers who produce them. We are great at making lattes, espressos and trying out new experiments.  Stop in to see how this all works.</p>
